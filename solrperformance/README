Attention: this is just a quick hack to pick up real user requests found in the logs of the productive Solr servers

principal idea (with two steps):
A. readLogs5x.py
- scan the list of logfiles
- use only the params query part
- make some transformations on this part for things we don't want or can't use
(in our case:
 -- sru.swissbib.ch is Java based and uses the native binary protocols. These are reflected in the logs and we can't make
http based requests in this test scenamrio
 -- filter for facet only requests (at the moment harrdcoded)

 - the final request we want to use for our test scenario are stored within schema-less Dcoument storage (in our case MongoDB)
 This makes it easy to store additional results (querytime and number of hits) even in parallel


 B. RunQueryies.py
 - baed on the stored (MongoDB) requests we can make stress tests against Solr servers (hard-coded!)
